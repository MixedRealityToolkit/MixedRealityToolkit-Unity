## [3.3.0] - 2025-11-12

### Added

* Added input action focus handling to disable controller/hand tracked state when the application goes out of focus. [PR #1039](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1039)
* Added ToInteractorHandedness extension for XRNode. [PR #1042](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1042)

### Changed

* Updated the MRTK Default Profile to use the Unity XR Hands subsystem by default instead of the Microsoft OpenXR Plugin subsystem. [PR #973](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/973)
* Updated the minimum editor version to 2022.3.6f1 [PR #1003](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1003)

### Removed

* Removed ITrackedInteractor, as it was supporting an unused codepath and there are better ways to get this data (like querying the attach transform). [PR #1044](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1044)
* Removed FindObjectUtility, as it was a backwards-compatibility layer for pre-2021.3.18. Since our min version is now 2022.3, we can just call the API directly. [PR #1056](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1056)

## Unreleased

### Added

* Added a project validation rule to ensure the Unity XR Hands subsystem is enabled in the OpenXR settings when the corresponding MRTK subsystem is enabled. [PR #973](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/973)
* Added support for Unity's com.unity.cloud.gltfast and com.unity.cloud.ktx packages when loading controller models. [PR #631](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/631)
* Added toggle for frame rate independent smoothing in camera simulation. [PR #1011](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1011)
* Added implementation for the synthesized TriggerButton, accounting for animation smoothing. [PR #1043](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1043)
* Added a "squeeze" alias for the grip states, to account for broader input action mapping support. [PR #1043](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1043)

### Fixed

* Fixed controller model fallback visualization becoming stuck visible when hands became tracked after initialization. [PR #984](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/984)

### Changed

* Updated the minimum editor version to 2022.3.6f1 [PR #1003](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1003)
* Updated tests to follow existing MRTK test patterns. [PR #1046](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1046)
* Remapped the synthetic hands config to read the float "select value" action instead of the bool "select" action, since it's read as a float. [PR #1043](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1043)
* Split out mappings for "airtap" and "grab", as well as mapping other bespoke interaction profile actions (like those provided by the Hand Interaction Profile). [PR #1040](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1040)

### Removed

* Removed HandNode property and field from HandModel, as it was largely unused. [PR #1045](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1045)

### Deprecated

* Deprecated IHandedInteractor across the interactor implementations, as its info is now queryable directly from IXRInteractor's handedness property. [PR #1042](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/1042)

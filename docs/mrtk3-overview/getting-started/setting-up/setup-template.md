# Starting from the MRTK3 template project

The easiest way to acquire and try out MRTK3 is to explore our pre-configured project. This project contains references to all of the current MRTK3 packages and comes pre-configured with the project settings required to deploy to device.

1. Clone the project from [the MRTK3 GitHub repo](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you work with Git using the command line, you can clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity.git`

1. Launch Unity (2021.3.21f1 or newer) on the `MRTKDevTemplate` project under `UnityProjects` and start playing with the sample scenes in the Unity editor by using input simulation, remoting, or deploying them to devices.

For information on the sample scenes included in the preview, see [Exploring MRTK3 sample scenes](../exploring-features/mrtk3-sample-scenes.md).

## Next steps

Once you've finished setting up your Unity project, choose one of the following options:

* Learn how to [experience your application on a device](../../test-and-deploy/overview.md)
* Proceed to [creating a new MRTK3 scene](./setup-new-scene.md)
